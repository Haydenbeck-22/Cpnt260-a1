#Reflection
  I had trouble aligning the images properly in the flexbox. I read documentation from W3Schools and the MDN in an attempt to overcome the problem, however I found the code for float: right; on stack overflow and that fixed my problem. 

 I was also unable to get the image to display on the github pages site, I am unsure of why this is.
# Footer
 I was unable to figure out what was happening with the white box in the footer element. I am unsure of what causes this.
