  #Client Info
    Client is Jane, an artist.
    They create art and host community events.

    #Reflection
      I had trouble aligning the images properly in the flexbox. I read documentation from W3Schools and the MDN in an attempt to overcome the problem, however I found the code for float: right; on stack overflow and that fixed my problem.
